## Editing

Edit in `Main.elm`.
Run `elm reactor` to get feedback from your editing, if you open an elm file (e.g. `Main.elm`), you will get its error feedback, if you open a html file (e.g. `index.html`), it will be rendered.

## Compiling

Compile with:

```
elm make src/Main.elm --output elm.js
```

You can then view by opening `index.html` in your browser.

Make sure this and `elm.js` are pushed to update the website.
