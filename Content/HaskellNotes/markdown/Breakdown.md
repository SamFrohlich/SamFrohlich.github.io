# Breakdown

breakdown into the smallest blocks, then use tags/labels to naviagte them

we could also collect together things like typeclass what why pages as a list of links

each note should have one purpose, and say what it contains and its goal/aim e.g. this note tells you how the list data type is constructed in haskell. BY the end you shold understand the data definition of lists in haskel and why it is like that

Things to sort:
types - what
types - why (motivation)
haskell types - basic (PoDs)
haskell types - custom types
haskell types - common structures
product types
sum types
polymorphism / generalisation of types
type classes - what
type classes - why
type classes - examples / common ones
type classes - making one
pattern matching
if statemenents in haskell
case statements in haskell
haskell - guards
haskell where clauses
haskell let clauses
how i program in haskell
haskeel - function syntax - named and unnamed
point free style
lazy eval
eager evel
equational readoning in haskell
structural induction proofs
haskell lists
haskell list comprehensions
recurion
recursive functions
recursive data types
map function
  #common functions
  #list function
folds
foldr
  #common functions
  #list function
monoids
monoid type class
show type class

^ instead go through each set of notes in turn, creating a small module with aim, just like the quidditch drills, then slowly add to it from different sources

NON LINEAR factlets

we should have a glorrasry, and always link technical words like nlab

ways of navigating:
  beaten path - a suggested nav
  forging own way - link jumping, going from something u know then following suggested links
  teleport - search when u know what your looking for
