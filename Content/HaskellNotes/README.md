Welcome to the Haskell notes!

The notes are written in md so that they can be easily turned into parts of my website.

There is also the ability to convert the md notes into pdfs so that I can give them to students. To convert:
1. Enter the nix shell
2. Run "make"

> NOTE:- to have images work for both the md and pdf notes they are must be in the root folder and next to the md files.
