# Why Bother?

*image of one of those kids shape hole things*

Seems like a lot of hassle. What do we gain?

Pros
  - great way of specifying code:
      name and type are effective at communicating and giving and intuition of what a function does
  - Helps guide the implemntor
      type driven coding (slow refinement, like a paining sketch that you slowly add detail to)
  - Stops errors being make

Example
  - consider something you enjoy doing

I'll pick baking

  - consider how you would type this activity to improve it by the following aspects:
    * specification
    * guidance
    * error prevention
